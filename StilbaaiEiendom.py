The purpose of this script is to crawl property24 (perhaps more websites later) and check the prices
of property in Still Bay, Western Cape, South Africa.

Some functionality may later include to check the trends of prices.

Maybe play with SQL and calculate average prices over the course of however many days.

I have no idea how I would go about to implement this, so this will consist of reading a lot of
tutorials and playing around
